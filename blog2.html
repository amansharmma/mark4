        <h3>The Blog is for students who want to know about programming.</h3>
        <strong>Let me introduce some programming languages JavaScript, Python, C, C++</strong>
        <p>We are not going to learn about programming languages which I have mentioned above.</p>
        <p>We are going to read or learn the fundamentals of programming.<br>Because programmers used languages above their Syntex are different but the fundamentals are the same.</p>
    <Strong>For now</Strong>
        <p>Let’s have some knowledge that what programmers use for working with variables, lists.<br>
            Let's go one by one with an example and understand the concept.</p>
        <p>First of all, let’s get understand that what is variable.
        </p>
        <strong>Variable:-</strong>
        <p>So, basically variable is nothing more than a container. In which you can store data.<br>
            Let’s have a real-life example for a better understanding.</p>
        <strong>Example:- 
            Bucket = water</strong>
            <p>Assume that you have a bucket and you can fill it with water.
            </p>
        <strong>List:- </strong>
        <p>
            As we read about variables in which we can store any type of data.<br>
        The list is also the same as a variable but in the list, you can store more than one data.<br>
        Let’s have a real-life example for a better understanding.</p>
        <strong>Example:-
            Room = [Bed, fan, Fridge]</strong>
        <p>Assume that you have a room and you can fill it with anything it can be Bed, fan, Fridge etc.
